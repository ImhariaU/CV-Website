          <h2>Hi there! Welcome to my website</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Imhariaosoria Ughu and I just finished studying Chemical
            Engineering at the University of Leeds. I chose chemical engineering
            because I knew it was a great course that would give me the
            opportunity to explore my interest and not limit me in any way. The
            things I have learnt and the skills I have picked up are applicable
            to so many different sectors and roles. I wasn't someone who always
            knew what the wanted to be so I had a few internships in different
            sectors which has really expanded my view and actually helped me
            come to the point i am now where I have realised my deep passion for
            technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            For as long as I can remember, I have always been described as
            observant and this is because I am honestly just fascinated by
            people. I want to understand why they do the things they do and how
            those factors are important in their decision making. I want to
            understand why I see the general trends we see in everyday life and
            why people function the way they do. This is why I have always love
            Maths as you notice important patterns and trends. I have always
            been interested in a range of things which is why when something
            catches my interest, I usually try to learn all about it. This drive
            and thirst for knowledge has led me to become a great cook and I
            also have extensive knowledge of the solar system. I have a strong
            desire to learn and push beyond my comfort zone which is why I am
            currently teaching myself how to code in python and I have started
            weight training. I also started coding because I really love
            technology and want to be a contributor to the field. I read so many
            articles and watch so many videos about different emerging
            technologies and their applications which makes me very excited for
            the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to advance, I believe it is very important to learn from my
            mistakes which is why I note them down and reflect on how to do
            better. I also have discussions with people around me about my
            mistakes and I really value different perspectives. This has really
            helped me learn how to pick myself up and move on and because of my
            natural drive, I have overcome many obstacles. I am very grateful
            for the people around me and love having the opportunity to work
            with such a range of characters.
